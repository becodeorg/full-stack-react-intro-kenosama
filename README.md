# The Todo app :) 

For this moment, we have to make a ToDo app stored locally,

On the first day, we have to understand the principle of Components and how to insert it into the App. 

I worked with Shared components, by that, i mean, i want to re-use my components if i need, so the InputForm is easily re-usable for a future project if needed.  you will find them into the [Components/Shared Folder](/src/Components/Shared)
